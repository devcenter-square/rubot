~~An expirement in onboarding for the Udacity Rubyists Slack team!~~  [Cloned](https://github.com/FuzzWorley/rubot) and customized for the DC slack team. 

[Watch a short demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mlgRz-lgVw).

## What does the bot do?

1. **Messages**

  Schedule messages to be sent to new Slack team members based on how long they have been a member. For example, one message could immediately welcome the user and offering an orientation while another is scheduled to offer 1:1 appointments 5 days later.

  The goal is to schedule messages at strategic intervals in hopes of increasing engagement and retention.

2. **Interactions**

  Set user input, or trigger words, and a response. The bot will respond whenever somebody sends the trigger word to it.

3. **Blasts**

  Send a direct message from the bot to every user on your team.

4. **Data!**

  The application is configured to send data to Segment and integrate with Chartio automatically!

5. **Etc.**

  The UI also contains information about every user on your team and some metrics about bot usage.

  See [**Original** RuBot's UI](https://rubot.udacity.com/)


## Customize the bot for your own team.

Original codebase with instructions for customizing can also [be found here](https://github.com/FuzzWorley/rubot#customize-the-bot-for-your-own-team)

## Analytics

The program is setup to be tracking the teams metrics via google analytics integration. However, the bot needs to be invited into each channel that you want to run analytics on.
